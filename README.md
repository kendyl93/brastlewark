# APP

**App was created to take part in previous recrutation process purposes**

I created the app with `create-react-app` to avoid configuration to start react project. I would like to start shortly, so I think it will be better to help myself with the starting boilerplate.

## Installed packages

- **react-virtualized** package installed to prevent slow rendering the App. As it we have much data to display we need that package.

- **react-router-dom** package installed to apply routing easily. At that kinf of simple Apps react-router-dom is good enough to save time and code in React with hapiness ! :)

- **Feather-Icons** package installed to get icons and make app more gnome friendly.

- **Recharts** package installed to apply statistics in a bar and pie charts.

- **styled-components** package installed to easily write CSS inside JS files.

## Another important notes

- Run `npm install` in root project directory to install all packages
- **Run `npm start` in order to start the app in browser**
- Run `npm test` to run JEST test of this app.
